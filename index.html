            <p class="text">Sometimes movies are more complicated than four-volume novels.
                But you learn to read books in school, but you don't learn to watch movies.
                And without preparation, it can be difficult to enjoy watching a movie.
                <br> <br> In this 8-session course we will learn how to be conscious viewers.
                We will get acquainted with the stages of film production and learn how to watch a movie through the
                eyes of a screenwriter, director and editor.
                We will understand genres and look at the most important films, from Citizen Kane to The Matrix.
